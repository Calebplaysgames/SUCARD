# Steven Universe - title card generator!
This is a fork of a Steven Universe title card generator; You can find it [Here](https://github.com/SpopovabgS/SU-titlecard-generator) it was made by [SpopovabgS](https://github.com/SpopovabgS)
## How does this work?
From looking through it; this project is built from HTML, JavaScript and CSS and uses V5 of the [Crewniverse](https://www.deviantart.com/maxigamer/art/Crewniverse-Font-V-5-MORE-ACCENTS-AND-SYMBOLS-540122768) font made by [MaxiGamer](https://www.deviantart.com/maxigamer) on DeviantArt.
## What does it work on?
SpopovabgS only tested it on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox and I've tested it on the current version of  
Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge Chromium.
